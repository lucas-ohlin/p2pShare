Simple peer too peer file sharing application made with electron.

# Dev mode
You need to run: 
```
node src/server.js
```
Since it's a peer to peer connection between two browsers (electron clients), other than that to run the application just do:
```
npm run start
```

# Build
Build works fine but currently needs to run the server.js to signal 
```
npm run build
```
